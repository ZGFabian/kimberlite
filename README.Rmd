> "Kimberlite is an igneous rock, which sometimes contains diamonds. It is named
> after the town of Kimberley in South Africa, where the discovery of
> an 83.5-carat (16.70 g) diamond called the Star of South Africa in 1869
> spawned a diamond rush and the digging of the open-pit mine called the Big Hole."

This package is not more than a fork of [ochRe](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ochRe) package. The goal of kimberlite is to create some named color palettes for ggplot2 and base R graphics. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of kimberlite from [github](https://github.com/ZGFabian/kimberlite) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("zgfabian/kimberlite")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(kimberlite)
library(ggplot2)
## basic example code
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_kimberlite() +
  labs(title = "default: coolors")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
