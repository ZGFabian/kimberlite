# kimberlite

> "**Kimberlite** is an igneous rock, which sometimes contains diamonds. It is named
> after the town of Kimberley in South Africa, where the discovery of
> a (...) diamond called the Star of South Africa in 1869
> spawned a diamond rush and the digging of the open-pit mine called the Big Hole."

This package is a fork of [**ochRe**](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ochRe) library. The goal of kimberlite is to create some named color palettes for ggplot2 and base R graphics. As the name suggest palettes were inspired by kimberlites and diamonds. It is also provides `theme_kimberlite`. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of kimberlite from [github](https://github.com/ZGFabian/kimberlite) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("zgfabian/kimberlite")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r, example}
library(kimberlite)
library(ggplot2)
## basic example code
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_kimberlite() +
  theme_kimberlite() +
  labs(title = "default: coolors")
```

Currently for palettes are available via `kimberlite_pal()` function.
